Hello I'm The ARCHIVIST. 20 yrs old. It/He/Eye pronouns.

PLEASE CALL ME KRIS, IUDEX OR JON.

I am a frequent PT player, youll usually see me hanging around the Genshin area or the Bakery

Things to keep in mind;

I am a suspected OSDD system and have introjects (Jon and Iudex).
I also have OCD so may struggle to be responsive at times.
Please be respectful of this.

THIS IS OKAY;

Asking about my system, we're figuring things out but questions are welcome.

C+H is cool, just dont block me

Whispers are very welcome!

DNI;

BIG NO:
Minors (you shouldnt be on the 18+ server), Venting to me out of the blue (ask first at least), Flirting (im in a relationship, seriously dont), Proship, fakeclaimers, general dni criteria, KS fans, south park fans, dream fans, danganronpa fans

Furina x Neuvillette makes us really uncomfortable. 

I am not interested in roleplay

Do not copy my pony designs, especially not Iudex and Jon's.

That's all! Thanks for reading.
